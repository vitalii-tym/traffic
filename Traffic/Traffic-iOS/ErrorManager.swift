//  An example on how to use the anyErrors() function:
//
//  let dataTask: NSURLSessionDataTask = self.urlSession.dataTaskWithRequest(request) { (data, response, error) -> Void in
//      NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock({ () -> Void in
//          if !anyErrors("do_transition", controller: self, data: data, response: response, error: error, quiteMode: false) {
//                  // Do work need to do when there were no errors
//              } else {
//                  // If there's something else to do after user has dismissed the error
//                  // but mind the "cancel" type of errors - when the session was cancelled by user going away
//              }
//          })
//      }
//      dataTask.resume()
